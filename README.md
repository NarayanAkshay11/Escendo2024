Code &amp; Documents for Escendo 2024 - Sustainability Hackthon

[Dataset 1](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires)

### Purpose
If humans are the only beings alive on earth, life will perish. This project aims to automize the duties of a forest ranger to aid their tasks and reduce their domain to animal relations.

### Problem Statement
Developing a machine to monitor forest activities and report/alert forest fires and illegal logging.

### Prototype
Train a classifier model to predict anomalies in regular forest environment, thus reporting forest fires and logging using temperature, moisture, sound and fire sensors. ESP32 Processor
used and the model is loaded onto the processor for remote predictions.

### Future Scope - Efforts made outside hackathon
Developing a mini drone for better movement and reducing the number of machines needed.
Making the same solar powered for better remote ability.
Enhancing ML model by employing CNN for image classification. Reinforcement learning to be applied for fire prediction.
Improving scope of project from fire detection to forest preserver.

### Primary Focus at the moment - Data Collection & Government Support
Need to form a registered corporation for a larger impact.
